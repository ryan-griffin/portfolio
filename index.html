                    <img src="images/alice_game.jpg" />
                    <p>
                        For this project I used the program alice to create a
                        game. Alice uses block code to emulate Java. The
                        character in the game is a turtle who has to eliminate
                        all the aliens in order to win. The alien has a bow and
                        arrow to kill the aliens with. the aliens kill the
                        player with a melee attack. At the end of the game there
                        is a large boss alien to kill, when the boss is killed
                        you win the game. To make this game I learned how to add
                        a movement system and collision. I created AI to make
                        the aliens seek towards the player to attack. I designed
                        the map also.

                    <img src="images/unreal_engine_game.jpg" />
                    <p>
                        For this project I learned about game development using
                        unreal engine and I created a basic FPS game. I learned
                        how to implement physics such as gravity and collision.
                        I was able to create movement system with jumping and
                        crouching. I created a health system that allows the
                        player to take damage from the zombies when they attack.
                        The zombies have a basic AI that makes them run towards
                        the player when they see him. A gun is used to kill the
                        zombies, it has an ammo counter and can reanimate. The
                        player and zombies are complete with animations. I made
                        the UI show all the useful information needed such as
                        ammo count, grenade count, health, objective, and the
                        minimap. I also designed a map.

                        I created a basic calculator using python. It includes
                        the basic functions like adding, subtracting,
                        multiplication and division.
